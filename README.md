Raspberry Pi Zoo Camera viewer

This is a simple zoo camera viewer for the raspberry pi.  Once installed you can configure the app to view any number of cameras at once (limited by your connection and hardware) and "zoom in" to a single view through the configured "remote" (which is just a basic website).
